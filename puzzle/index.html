		<p>
			The goal of the fifteen puzzle is to un-jumble its fifteen squares
			by repeatedly making moves that slide squares into the empty space.
			How quickly can you solve it?

			American puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely
			credited with creating the puzzle; indeed, Loyd claimed from 1891
			until his death in 1911 that he invented it.
			The puzzle was actually created around 1874 by Noyes Palmer Chapman,
			a postmaster in Canastota, New York.
